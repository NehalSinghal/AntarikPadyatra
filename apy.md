* Inputs by Us

 1. Seeds thrown where they can grow in water-areas. Birds pollinate. Saplings cannot be taken everywhere. Even 1000 seeds can be taken but same number of saplings cannot be taken. 
   2. The right place for the seeds to be listed.
   3. **Treeman: If all the gram is exhausted and only one gram seed is left, then that one gram will feed everyone.**
   4. Seed -> Friendly Environment -> Marking
 5. **Where the tree is planted, it automatically preserve the soil.**
  6. Baanjh ka beej, FRI Dehradun
  7. Case against Treeman while working in the woods.  If someone does something then people think who has come, where has he come from. These are all practical problems.
 8. Speed dispersal. High potential. 
 9. Many people throw seeds from the rail. Some people may throw papaya seeds. Many seeds sprout. 
 10. Even if we leave that, walk on foot also great. 
 11. **Pick up the seeds, which seeds for which location, take care of them etc. This is work too. Management needed.**
 12. It will become Pujar gaon village like thing. Trees were planted in that village. (Mussourie plantation so that snow can come till low levels.)
 13. A thought moves through the journey, the culture awakens. That's it.
 14. Shri Dhan Singh Rana in Raini village near Joshimath.
 15. Niti is different, Maana is different. There are bears there. Trip with Atul Sati ji.  Had gone to Surai Khota also. There the post office is also on the road. Had gone too Malari. There is lonely road.  Later it was known that the bears come. No one comes. Went with Atul ji. Walked during day time. Got to know about bears coming later. 
 16. Everything is for self-purification.  If you connect with more people, then people will ask which organization they are from, which NGOs they are from.  Therefore, as much as you can for your self-satisfaction with your own hands do, it is enough.
 17. Many people will walk (in travel) out of curiosity or for tourism.  Each with own feeling. There is no problem.
  18. Short route from Helang to Joshimath?  A short path used by Shri Jaipal Singh Chauhan ji.
  19. TA Battalion: Territorial Army plants tree in Himalayas.
  20. "Plant trees in Badrinath. There is water. But seeds needed. Soil needed."  This work can be done only when it is motivated by public sentiment.
  21. People visit Badrinath are a lot. If people bring handful of mud also then it'll be a lot. 
  22. Goddess Santoshi is not mentioned anywhere in the scriptures.  Popular since movie release. 
  23. Kundan Singh Panwar ji in Nainbaag. Progressive farmer. Made gaumutra tanks. Did Chakbandi on his own with local people.
  24. People may join or not. God knows better. We do for our own self purification only. 
  25. We should **keep our intention pure**.  That's all.
  26. **Plan put on web. People can see.**
  27. Remember more friends.  So that the plan can be shared with those friends.
  28. **Telegram group** can be created.  All contacts given to Prithvi ji (son). A separate group of Antarik-Padyatra can be made.
  29. Prithvi ji can send us contacts. Then gradually plan will consolidate over next 2-3 months. 
  30. Ujjain will not come in way. It's very far from journey route. 
  31. Telegram group people will also give suggestions. They will give advice and other places.
